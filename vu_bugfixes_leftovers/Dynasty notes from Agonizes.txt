Trieste:

* No names from individual commune rulers found,
* It was some times a strong competitor of Venice.

Rijeka:
* “In the 14th century, Rijeka was the property of the Devins, the Krka-Frankopan bans, the Valza family, and since 1466 it has been owned by the Habsburgs, as part of Carniola (present-day central Slovenia).” From the Croatian wikipedia.
* The ‘Devin’ family was a Croatian noble family, the ‘Francopan’ family (Frankopani, Frankapani in Croatian and Frangipani  in Italian) where the most powerful dynasty in Croatia, and usually held the position of ‘Ban’ or ‘Viceroyal’ of Croatia during its union with Hungary, held Rijeka for a time and constructed the Trsat castle and walls around the medieval town.
* So in 1444 it seems likely that it was held by the ‘Valza’ dynasty(‘Valze’ in Croatian’), can’t find anything on this dynasty, but the name could be Croatian or Italian. 
* But it is possible to put it under the Frankipani's, they seem to have improved the town the most, even if it wasn’t one of their primary holdings.
* Fiume/Rijeka became a Habsburg possesion in 1466
* was an important competitor to the Venetians and thus valuable to the Habsburgs.


Hum:
* the Hum territory was held by the Kosaca family since the early 14th century. 
* the first member was Vuc Kosača, 1317–1359 , a powerful general under Serbian Emperor Dusan the Mighty (r. 1331–1359). He received lands around the Upper Drina.
* Vlatko Vuković Kosača (d. 1392), Vuc’s son and one of the best generals under the Bosnian king Tvrtko I. Defeated Ottoman armies several times. Consolidated the lands of the Duchy of Hum, also carried the title ‘Grand Duke of Bosnia’, second to the king.
* Sandalj Hranić Kosača (1370 – 15 March 1435), Vlatko’s nephew, succeeded him in 1392 as duke of Hum and Grand Duke of Bosnia. Continued consolidating the duchy and strengthened the position of the Kosaca. family, he was the most powerful magnate under the rule of king Stephen Ostoja and later Stephen Tvrtko II.  His first wife was named Jelena but at some point he remarried with ‘Katarina Hrvatinić’, from the powerful Hrvaninic dynasty. He divorced her in december 1411 and remarried at the end of that month with  ‘Jelena Balšić’ (d.1443) a daughter of Lazar of Serbia and sister of Stefan Lazarevic, thus allying himself with the Serbian kingdom. He quarreled with king Stephen Tvrtko during this time.
* Stjepan Vukčić Kosača (1404–1466), Sandalj’s nephew, succeeded him in 1435 as Duke of Hum and Grand duke of Bosnia. Refused to recognise king Tomas as his king and instead proclaimed himself a semi- independent Duke. He allied himself first with the Ottomans and then Aragon and then the Ottoman empire again. in 1446 the parties made peace, Stjepan recognised Tomas as king and in turn Tomas married Stjepans daughter Catharina. Conflict renewed in 1448 when Stjepan declared himself  Herceg of Saint Sava. In 1463, after the conquest of the kingdom of Bosnia, Ottoman forces invaded the duchy. Stjepan conceded a truce by sending his youngest son as hostage to Istanbul, who would become five time Grand Vizier of the Ottoman empire and married a daughter of Bayezid II.  He was succeeded by his oldest son. Stjepan married three times: First in 1424 to Jelena, daughter of Balša III of Zeta. She died in 1453, two years later he married ‘Barbara del Balzo’(italian-dalmatian lady), she died in 1459. His final marriage in 1460 to a german woman named Cecilie. Stjepan, like all members of the dynasty often switched religion, between catholic and Orthodox.
* Vladislav Hercegović (1426 or 1427 – 1489), succeeded his father in 1466. After 1453 he often served the Ottoman empire, Venice and Hungary as mercenary. As a vassal of the Ottomans (after 1469) he supported their military campaigns. He escaped annexation by the Ottomans until 1480, after this his territory was gradually annexed. He died, landless, on the island of Rab (under venetian rule). He was married to Anna Kantakouzene, one of the five known daughters of George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos, in 1453 or 1454. He had a son,  Balša, who was the titular "Duke of St. Sava".
